# design-Pattern
These are the important design pattern according to Our Principle of programming language  2 class.

Here are the few Important Code of design pattern which might be helpfull a lot whenever we are dealing with Different Type of problems

Design Patterns 

 creational  pattern 
 Strctural  pattern
 Behavioral Pattern

Singalton Pattern : it should  have only one object inside in class and Any Object Pool will be having singalton Pattern.

 Object Pool should contain Singalton pattern.
 
 Factory Method of Design Pattren :
  Virtual Pointer 
  Virtual Table 
 
 templete Method 
 Abstract Factory Method : It is a Generalization of Factory Method.
 
 Bulider : Builder is a part of Creational Pattern.
 Prototype : It is also a part of creational Design Pattern.
 
 Shallow copy / deep copy.
 
 STRCTURAL PATTERN :
 
 1 Adapter is a seperate design a pattern.
 2 Bridge is a generalization of Adapter.
 3 Composite is also a behavioral Design pattern.
 4 decoder and Wapper 
 
 Iterator In c++
 Forward Iterator,backward iterator, Random iterator.Search for the type of iterator in C++.
 Header algorithm in C++.
 
 Visitor : Visitor is used for traversal of composite object. Just we Use in  Binary Search Tree.
 
 It can Find Number of addition in composite program.
 P0 -> (visit)
 f0 -> (visit)
 
 Example of Visitor : It can help to find the number of Addition in a given program 
 or Lets say Add 1 in all the element of the Binary search tree;
 
 Lets take another example :
 Preorder Visitor , Inorder Visitor , Postorder Visitor
 
 Composite Object knows the layout of the object Visotor Does not know the layout of teh Object.
 
 Composite Object has to provide layout to Visitor.
 
 Observer : It is new design pattern Specially Used for GUI and Specially For Game design.
 
 Change Manager : Pushmode/Pullmode.
